# Car Resale & Performance Analytics

## Overview

This project involves creating an interactive Excel dashboard to analyze car sales data. The dashboard presents key insights into resale value, unit sales, and performance metrics using various pivot table-generated visualizations. The aim is to highlight essential trends without overwhelming the user with excessive data.

## Data Source

The primary dataset is "Car Sales" worksheet. Pivot tables are derived from this data to generate meaningful visualizations that provide insights into different aspects of car sales performance.

## Dashboard Features
The `Dashboard` worksheet integrates these visualizations to provide a concise and interactive representation of the dataset. Users can interact with slicers to filter data based on manufacturer and model preferences, enabling customized insights. 

### Key features include:

-	**Comparison of Japanese Cars using bar graph** – Users can analyze annual resale value and average price trends using an interactive slicer. Toyota manufacturer have been used here for drilling down more into the specific of one particular manufacturer.
  
  - **Toyota-Specific Analysis** – Detailed insights into Toyota models using:
     - **Pie Chart** for retention percentage of Toyota cars.
     - **Column Chart** for Power Performance Factor.
     - **Sunburst Chart** for unit sales of Toyota cars.
    
•	**Drill-Down Functionality** – Users can refine their analysis by selecting specific Toyota models or any other car brand using slicers.

## Results

**Alexus** and **Accura** have the highest average price and annual resale value among various Japanese car models. 

As a renowned Japanese car manufacturer celebrated for its reliability and quality, **Toyota** serves as a focal point in other graphs due to its prominent market presence and well-regarded reputation. 

Toyota models, such as  **Corolla** and **Camry** are seen to have high retention percentages, making them attractive options for potential buyers concerned with value retention over time.

In terms of performance,  **Land Cruiser** stands out with the highest engine efficiency and power, followed by the **Avalon** and **Sienna**. These models exemplify Toyota's commitment to combining robust performance with practicality.

When it comes to market demand,  **Camry** leads in unit sales, reflecting its popularity among consumers. **Corolla** follows closely, underscoring its status as a highly sought-after model within Toyota's lineup. These insights collectively highlight Toyota's strong position in the automotive market, driven by its reliable performance, enduring value, and consumer preference.

To utilize the workbook dashboard effectively, please refer to [Usage](#usage) section for instructions.

## Purpose

The objective of this project is to present a well-structured, user-friendly dashboard that enables stakeholders to:

-	Compare the resale and price trends of Japanese cars (used as an example here).
-	Gain insights into Toyota's performance metrics.
-	Analyze retention percentages across different models of a manufacturer.
-	Interact with the dataset dynamically using slicers.

## Conclusion

Dashboard can effectively consolidates key automotive sales insights into a user-friendly, interactive format. The Toyota-specific analysis further enhances the understanding of model distribution, sales performance, and power performance factors. With interactive slicers, users can refine their analysis by filtering data based on manufacturers and models, enabling deeper insights into specific trends. Users can change using slicer depending on which manufacture and which car model they want to view and compare.
